.SH NAME
_printf()

The _printf() function reverbs the functionality of printf().
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"

.B int _printf(const char *format, ...)

.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf() functions writes outputs according to a format as described below:

.B FORMAT OF THE STRING
.RS 3
The format string is a character string, begining and ending in double quotes and its initial shift state.
The format string is composed of ordinary characters which are copied unchanged to the output
and conversion specifications introduced by %, and ends with a conversion specifier.
.RE

.B RETURN VALUE
.RS 3
On successful return, the functions return the number of characters printed excluding the null bytes used to end output to the string.
If an output error occurs, a negative value is returned.

.B THE CONVERSION SPECIFIER
.RS 3
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The following are the conversion specifiers and their meanings:

.B d, i
.RS 6
This argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.RE

.B c
.RS 6
This argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.RE

.B s
.RS 6
The \fIconst char*\fR argument is expected to be a pointer to a string.
.RE

.B %
.RS 6
When this is written, no argument is converted and the complete conversion specifications is '%%'.
.RE

.B u
.RS 6
This prints an unsigned int.
.RE

.B x, X
.RS 6
This prints a character in lowercase and upper case respectively.
.RE

.B o, b
.RS 6
This prints a number in octal and binary respectively.
.RE

.B r, R
.RS 6
This prints a string in reverse and in ROT13 encryption respectively.
.RE

.B S
.RS 6
This prints a string.
.RE

.B p
.RS 6
This prints an address given by pointer value.
.RE

.SH NOTES
The program doesn't account for flag characters, field width, precision and length modifiers.
_printf uses a custom character printing function called _putchar, that uses the system call write().
_putchar uses a static buffer of 1024 bytes and a static incrementing variable.
